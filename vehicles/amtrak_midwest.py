# Calculate power-weight ratio
power = 3300 # kW, Siemens Charger SC-44
locomotive_mass = 120 # t
empty_railcar_mass = 50.802 # t
average_person_mass = 0.08405 # t
total_mass = locomotive_mass + 5*(empty_railcar_mass + 60*average_person_mass)

power_weight_ratio  = power/total_mass     # kW per tonne → power/weight ratio
initial_accel       = 0.3       # initial max accel (m/s²)
max_speed           = 200       # max speed (km/h)

# Running resistance (m/s)
# The acceleration caused by running resistance is calculated as
#   a_res = a + bv + cv^2.

# Many datasheets provide coefficients for calculating the force caused by running resistance
#   F_res = A + Bv + Cv^2.
# Since F=ma, you can divide by the mass of the entire trainset in order to find
# the running resistance coefficients for acceleration caused by running resistance.

# These values are from the following paper:

# They apply to the X 2000, but the effect is negligible below 160 km/h.
