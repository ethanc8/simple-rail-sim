power_weight_ratio  = 26.74 # kW per tonne → power/weight ratio
initial_accel       = 0.9   # initial max accel (m/s²)
max_speed           = 300   # max speed (km/h)

# Running resistance (m/s)
# The acceleration caused by running resistance is calculated as
#   a_res = a + bv + cv^2.

# Many datasheets provide coefficients for calculating the force caused by running resistance
#   F_res = A + Bv + Cv^2.
# Since F=ma, you can divide by the mass of the entire trainset in order to find
# the running resistance coefficients for acceleration caused by running resistance.

# These values are from the following paper:

# They apply to the X 2000, but it should be similar to other high-speed trainsets.
a_coef = 0.0059         # Running resistance a (constant)
b_coef = 0.000118       # Running resistance b (linear)

# This value was experimentally measured by Alon Levy.

c_coef = 0.000018       # Running resistance c (quadratic)
