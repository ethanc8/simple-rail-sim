power_weight_ratio  = 11.50     # kW per tonne → power/weight ratio
# Initial acceleration is unknown; we assume the same as the N700 Shinkansen
initial_accel       = 0.9       # initial max accel (m/s²)
max_speed           = 210       # max speed (km/h)

# Running resistance (m/s)
# The acceleration caused by running resistance is calculated as
#   a_res = a + bv + cv^2.

# Many datasheets provide coefficients for calculating the force caused by running resistance
#   F_res = A + Bv + Cv^2.
# Since F=ma, you can divide by the mass of the entire trainset in order to find
# the running resistance coefficients for acceleration caused by running resistance.

# These values are from the following paper:
