# Running resistance (m/s)a
# The acceleration caused by running resistance is calculated as
#   a_res = a + bv + cv^2.

# Many datasheets provide coefficients for calculating the force caused by running resistance
#   F_res = A + Bv + Cv^2.
# Since F=ma, you can divide by the mass of the entire trainset in order to find
# the running resistance coefficients for acceleration caused by running resistance.

# These values are from the following paper:

# They apply to the X 2000, but the effect is negligible below 160 km/h.
